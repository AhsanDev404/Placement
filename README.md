# Programming Fundamentals Q&A

## Compile-time vs Runtime
**Q:** What is the difference between compile-time and runtime?

**A:** Compile-time refers to code conversion into an executable form, while runtime is when the program is executed.

## Compiler vs Interpreter
**Q:** What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
**A:** A compiler translates the entire source code into machine code, whereas an interpreter translates and executes code line by line.

## Variables vs Constants
**Q:** What is the difference between a variable and a constant?
**A:** A variable is a storage location holding a value, while a constant remains unchanged during program execution.

## Assignment Operators in Programming
**Q:** What is the difference between =, ==, and === in programming languages?
**A:** = assigns a value, == compares values for equality, and === compares both values and data types.

## Loops and Control Statements
**Q:** What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?
**A:** A while loop checks the condition first; if false, the loop doesn't execute. A do-while loop always executes at least once.

**Q:** What is the purpose of the break statement in a loop?
**A:** The break statement exits a loop prematurely, regardless of the loop condition.

**Q:** What is the purpose of the continue statement in a loop?
**A:** The continue statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

## Variables Scope and Functions
**Q:** What is the difference between a local variable and a global variable?
**A:** A local variable is scoped within a function, while a global variable is accessible throughout the program.

**Q:** What is the purpose of the return statement in a function?
**A:** The return statement exits a function and optionally returns a value to the caller.

## Function Parameters and Data Structures
**Q:** What is the difference between pass by value and pass by reference?
**A:** Pass by value copies the argument, while pass by reference passes the memory address of the argument.

**Q:** What is the purpose of an array in programming?
**A:** An array stores multiple values of the same data type in contiguous memory locations.

## Strings, Characters, and Conditional Statements
**Q:** What is the difference between a string and a character?
**A:** A character is a single alphanumeric/special character, while a string is a sequence of characters.

**Q:** What is the purpose of conditional statements in programming?
**A:** Conditional statements execute different code blocks based on a specified condition.

## Operators and Preprocessor Directives
**Q:** What is the purpose of the modulus operator (%) in programming?
**A:** The modulus operator returns the remainder of a division operation.

**Q:** What is a function and why is it used in programming?
**A:** A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task, promoting reusability and improving readability.

**Q:** What is recursion in programming?
**A:** Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem, breaking it into smaller subproblems.

## Memory Management and File Structure
**Q:** What is the difference between a stack and a heap?
**A:** A stack is used for static memory allocation, storing local variables and function call information. A heap is used for dynamic memory allocation, storing objects and data structures.

**Q:** What is the difference between a header file and a source file?
**A:** A header file contains declarations and function prototypes, while a source file contains the actual implementation of functions.

**Q:** What is the purpose of a preprocessor directive in programming?
**A:** Preprocessor directives provide instructions to the compiler before compilation, used for including header files, macro definitions, conditional compilation, etc.
