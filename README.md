# Programming Fundamentals Q&A

## Compile-time vs Runtime
**Q:** What is the difference between compile-time and runtime?

**A:** Compile-time refers to code conversion into an executable form, while runtime is when the program is executed.

## Compiler vs Interpreter
**Q:** What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?

**A:** A compiler translates the entire source code into machine code, whereas an interpreter translates and executes code line by line.

## Variables vs Constants
**Q:** What is the difference between a variable and a constant?

**A:** A variable is a storage location holding a value, while a constant remains unchanged during program execution.

## Assignment Operators in Programming
**Q:** What is the difference between =, ==, and === in programming languages?

**A:** = assigns a value, == compares values for equality, and === compares both values and data types.

## Loops and Control Statements
**Q:** What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?

**A:** A while loop checks the condition first; if false, the loop doesn't execute. A do-while loop always executes at least once.

**Q:** What is the purpose of the break statement in a loop?

**A:** The break statement exits a loop prematurely, regardless of the loop condition.

**Q:** What is the purpose of the continue statement in a loop?

**A:** The continue statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

## Variables Scope and Functions
**Q:** What is the difference between a local variable and a global variable?

**A:** A local variable is scoped within a function, while a global variable is accessible throughout the program.

**Q:** What is the purpose of the return statement in a function?

**A:** The return statement exits a function and optionally returns a value to the caller.

## Function Parameters and Data Structures
**Q:** What is the difference between pass by value and pass by reference?

**Q:** What is the purpose of an array in programming?

**A:** An array stores multiple values of the same data type in contiguous memory locations.

## Strings, Characters, and Conditional Statements
**Q:** What is the difference between a string and a character?

# Object Oriented Programming Q&A

## What is Object-Oriented Programming?
**Q:** What is Object-Oriented Programming?

**A:** Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm organizing code into objects with properties and behaviors, emphasizing encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## Four Fundamental Principles of OOP
**Q:** What are the four fundamental principles of OOP?

**A:** The four fundamental principles of OOP are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## Encapsulation in OOP
**Q:** What is encapsulation in OOP?

**A:** Encapsulation bundles data and methods into an object, providing data hiding and internal state protection.

## Inheritance in OOP
**Q:** What is inheritance in OOP?

**A:** Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, promoting code reuse and hierarchy creation.

## Polymorphism in OOP
**Q:** What is polymorphism in OOP?

**A:** Polymorphism enables an object to take multiple forms, treating different class objects as a common superclass, achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

## Method Overriding in OOP
**Q:** What is method overriding in OOP?

**A:** Method overriding lets a subclass provide a different implementation of a method defined in its superclass, enabling runtime polymorphism.

## Method Overloading in OOP
**Q:** What is method overloading in OOP?

**A:** Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, determined by passed arguments, enabling compile-time polymorphism.

## Abstraction vs Encapsulation
**Q:** What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?

**A:** Abstraction hides unnecessary details and provides a simplified interface, while encapsulation bundles data and methods, protecting the internal state of an object.

## Class vs Object
**Q:** What is the difference between a class and an object?

**A:** A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, defining their properties and behaviors, while an object is an instance of a class.

## Purpose of 'this' Keyword in OOP
**Q:** What is the purpose of the 'this' keyword in OOP?

**A:** 'this' refers to the current object within a class, used to differentiate instance variables and local variables, invoke constructors, and pass the current object as an argument to other methods.

## Composition vs Inheritance
**Q:** What is the difference between composition and inheritance?

**A:** Composition involves a class being composed of objects of other classes as members, while inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.

## Abstract Class in OOP
**Q:** What is an abstract class in OOP?

**A:** An abstract class cannot be instantiated, serves as a blueprint, and can have both defined and undefined (abstract) methods, guiding concrete subclasses.

## Interface in OOP
**Q:** What is an interface in OOP?

**A:** An interface defines a contract with abstract methods for classes to implement, specifying required methods without providing implementations.

## Abstract Class vs Interface
**Q:** What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?

**A:** An abstract class can have both defined and undefined methods, while an interface only has undefined methods. A class can implement multiple interfaces but inherit from only one class.

## Method Overloading vs Method Overriding
**Q:** What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?

**A:** Method overloading occurs with multiple methods of the same name but different parameters in a class. Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a different implementation of a method defined in its superclass.
